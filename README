gcpulsars README
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

gcpulsars is a Bayesian analysis + Monte Carlo simulation toolset to constrain
the population size of radio pulsars in the Galactic centre. For more details
on gcpulsars, please refer Chennamangalam and Lorimer (2014).

System and software requirements: The Python programs require the Numpy, Scipy,
and Matplotlib libraries.

To compile galcenbayes and galcenbayes_fixedf, just run 'make'.

Usage
-----

The typical sequence of program execution is as follows.

0. Run calcsmin.py: Calculates the S_min corresponding to the inner parsec,
    given survey parameters.
1. Run galcenbayes: Generates a file containing the posterior on N.
2. Run plotpdf.py: Plots the posterior PDF, as output by the previous step
    (similar to Figure 1 of paper).
3. Run fixedf_runmulti.rb: Runs galcenbayes_fixedf for a range of magnetar
    fractions.
4. Run plotnvsf.py: Plots the upper limit on N vs. magnetar fraction f, as
    output by the previous step (similar to Figure 2 of paper).
5. Run predictmulti.py: Runs the MC simulation for a given survey, given
    the posterior on N based on that survey.
6. Run predictmulti2.py: Runs the MC simulation for a range of values of N.
7. Run plotpredict.py: Plots n_obs vs. N, as output by the previous step
    (similar to Figure 3 of paper).

Please refer the individual source files for program usage information and
examples.
